Grok Asteroids
Play the game here

This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic game Asteroids, built with the assistance of Grok, an AI created by xAI.

Development Process
The following prompts were used to guide the development of this project:

"Build a javascript app that is the game asteroids"
This initiated the creation of the basic game structure, including the spaceship, asteroids, and lasers.
"have the canvas take up the entire screen"
This led to modifications making the game canvas responsive, filling the entire browser window.
"the ship flies sideways"
This prompt identified an issue with the spaceship's movement direction, which was corrected to align with its visual orientation.
"give me an updated asteriods.js"
This resulted in the final version of the game code, incorporating all previous fixes and improvements.
